/* 	TODO: Grid logic for basic rows and columns, as well as eight and four column cells

	We're going to use a gutter width of 2% to keep things simple, and a total number of columns of 12 as this is the industry norm
	
	Math breakdown: (total width - total width of gutters) / total columns = column width
	(100% - (2% * 11)) / 12 = 6.5% width columns

	columns = 6.5% width
	gutters = 2% width
